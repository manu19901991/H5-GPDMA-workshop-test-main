# Block transfer

Each BDTR size is called block for GPDMA. 
Each block can have multiple bursts. The number of bursts mus fit to BDTR size.

# Block trigger

The block transfer can be conditioned by trigger

## Block address offset

The channels 12-15 have possiblity to add offset between each burst inside block. The offset is +-8192.

## Repeated block

The channels 12-15 have possiblity to use repeated block feature. Which means the block transfer is repeated multiple times (2048)

# Repeated block trigger

The repeated block trigger can be conditoned by trigger

# Repeated block address offset

Also repeadet block can have additional address offset after the block is executed. 
The offset can be from +-65536

# Simple example

Decode JPEG like strucuture using repeated block.
