<br>
![H5_Lib_Install](./img/H5Lib.jpg)
<br>
- In case of library installation problems please try an alternative way:
  - download **STM32H5 Cube library** (.zip file)
  - run **STM32CubeMX**

<br>  
![U5_Lib_Install_from_local](./img/H5Lib_local.jpg)
<br>

<ainfo>
STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE are using the same repository by default, so installed STM32U5 Cube library will be visible in both tools.

# Verification process before you visit us
The purpose of this part is checking whether all software components are installed properly.
<br>
Additionally prepared test project can be a base for next hands-on parts during the workshop.

## **STM32CubeIDE and STM32H5 Cube library**
<br>

----

<br>
**Task definition**
<br>

- Using STM32CubeIDE
  - Enable SWD for debug
  - Disable TrustZone
  - Configure ICACHE (in any of available modes)
- Select and configure USART3
  - in asynchronous mode,
  - using default settings (115200bps, 8D, 1stop bit, no parity) 
  - on PA9/PA10 pins
<br>

----

<br>
## **Step1** - project creation and peripherals configuration
 - Run **STM32CubeIDE**
 - Specify workspace location (i.e. `C:\_Work\H5_GPDMA`)
<br>
![Workspace_start](./img/CubeIDE_WS.apng)
<br>
- Start new project using one of the below methods:
  - by selecting `File->New->STM32Project` 
  - by click on `Start new STM32 project` button
  <br>
  ![Workspace_start2](./img/New_prj_start_2.gif)
<br>
- switch to **Board Selector** tab
- select NUCLEO-**H563**ZI board
- press `Next` button
- within STM32 Project window:
  - specify project name (i.e. `H5_UART`)
  - keep **enable TrustZone** option unchecked
  - press `Finish` button
  - on question pop-up window "Initialize all peripherals with their default state?" press `No` button 
  - on question pop-up window "Switch to proper CubeIDE perspective?", if it is showed, press `Yes` button 
  - on worning pop-up window "Do you still want a code generation?", press `No` button 
  - on following information pop-up window, it was our decision did not generate code, press `OK` button 
  <br>
   ![Workspace_start3](./img/CubeIDE_Start.apng)
<br>
- Peripherals configuration: Pinout&Configuration tab
- **ICACHE configuration** (System Core group)
  - select either 1-way or 2-ways (we will not focus on performance within this workshop)
  <br>
  ![ICACHE configuration](./img/CubeIDE_ICACHE.apng)
  <br>
- **USART3 configuration** (Connectivity group)
  - select Asynchronous mode
  - keep default settings in configuration:
    - Basic parameters: 115200bps, 8bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity
    - Pins assignment: PD8, PD9
    - no interrupts, no DMA usage
  <br>
    ![USART3 configuration](./img/CubeIDE_UART.apng)
<br>
- **SWD configuration** (Trace and debug group)
  - select Serial wire debug
  - this is usually not necessary, because of default state of SWD pins, but it is good habit to do it
  <br>
    ![SWD configuration](./img/CubeIDE_SWD.apng)
<br>
- **Project settings**
  - select `Project Manager` tab
  - check project location (.ioc file)
  - check project name
<br>
   ![Project settings](./img/CubeIDE_Proj.apng)
<br>
  - generate project by one of the ways:
    - by pressing "gear" icon
    - by select `Project->Generate Code`
    - by pressing **Alt+K**
<br>
  ![Project generation](./img/CubeIDE_GenCode.apng)
<br>

----

<br>
## **Step2** - coding part (`main.c` file)
<br>
Define the buffer of bytes to be sent over **USART3** (`USER CODE PV` section):
<br>

```c
  uint8_t buffer[]={"Hello STM32H5\r\n"};
```

<br>
![Coding1](./img/CubeIDE_Coding1.apng)
<br>
Turn on **LED1_GREEN** (`USER CODE 2` section):
<br>

```c
  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LED1_GREEN_GPIO_Port, LED1_GREEN_Pin, 1);
```

<br>
![Coding2](./img/CubeIDE_Coding2.apng)
<br>
Toggle **LED1_GREEN** (`USER CODE 3` section)
<br>
Toggle **LED2_YELLOW** 
<br>
Start transmit of the data over **USART3** using prepared buffer and ***polling*** method
<br>
Wait for 250 ms
<br>

```c
  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LED1_GREEN_GPIO_Port, LED1_GREEN_Pin);
  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LED2_YELLOW_GPIO_Port, LED2_YELLOW_Pin);
  HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart3, buffer, 15, 200);
  HAL_Delay(250);
```

<br>
![Coding3](./img/CubeIDE_Coding3.apng)
<br>

----

<br>
## **Step 3** - build the project
- Build the project using `hammer` button or `Project->Built All` or **Ctrl+B**
<br>
![Project build](./img/CubeIDE_Build.apng)
<br>

<ainfo>
In case of neither errors nor warnings after this process, STM32CubeIDE and STM32U5 library are installed correctly. Last point - debug session will be verified during first hands on part on the workshop.
</ainfo>


<ainfo>
## **Congratulations** You have completed installation part. Now you are fully prepared for the live workshop session.

# **Appendix A** - configuration and start **STM32CubeIDE** built-in terminal  
<br>
### You can follow dedicated video on this topic [here from 8:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWOV4j5fCS4&list=PLnMKNibPkDnFCosVVv98U5dCulE6T3Iy8&index=11&t=569s)

- Being in the debug session (debug perspective), please go to Console window (bottom part of the screen) 
- select `New -> 3 Command Shell Console` 
- specify `Connection Type` to **Serial Port**
- select **New** within `Connection name` (in case of previously configured connections you can select them from the list)
- in case of new connection, select its name (i.e. `Internal_Term`)
- select port number (used by STLink Virtual COM port - usually highest from the list)
- adapt communication parameters if needed (in our case default settings are inline with application ones)
- to confirm press `Finish`
- press `OK` on the next window
- After proper configuration, Console will contain terminal window (already connected)
- It is possible to disconnect the terminal, connect it or close it

# Verification process at the begining of the session

  The purpose of this part is checking whether all software components can run with provided hardware boards.
  <br>
  **We will reuse the project prepared within homework part.**

- Please start STM32CubeIDE and open the project prepared before the session.
- Connect board to PC using micro-USB cable. Multicolor LED (right side of USB connector) should be turned on (red color)
<br>
![Board connection](./img/USB_connect.apng)
<br>
- Start the debug session using `bug` icon or `Run->debug` or by pressing **F11**
- All the settings should be automatically set based on your compiled project. Press `OK` button
- At this moment you may see an information window that your STLink firmware is not up-to-date,
- please accept this message and perform automatic upgrade process
- disconnect and conect USB cable
<br>
![STLink_upgrade](./img/CubeIDE_Upgrade.apng)
<br>
- Once more start the debug session using `bug` icon or `Run->debug` or by pressing **F11**
- Select `Switch` within `Configure Perspective Switch` dialog which is informing about new (debug one) windows setup within STM32CubeIDE application.
- Start terminal application and run it for virtual COM port number assigned to the NUCLEO board with settings: 115200bps, 8bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity, no HW control. As an alternative you can use STM32CubeIDE built-in terminal (please have a look within Appendix for more details)
- run the application within debug session. As a result within terminal there should be "Hello STM32H5" messages displayed.
